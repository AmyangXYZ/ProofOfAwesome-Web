# Proof of Awesome

<img src="./public/logo.png" height="144"/>

A blockchain-inspired social platform that transforms real-world achievements into verifiable digital assets.

## üöÄ Overview

**Proof of Awesome** reimagines blockchain technology as a social experience where users "mine" blocks through verified real-world accomplishments rather than computational puzzles. The platform combines blockchain mechanics with achievement tracking to create a compelling social experience with authentic utility.

Our platform features two key innovations:

1. **Achievement Consensus**: Instead of computational puzzles, we use a multi-round AI review system inspired by academic paper reviews. Multiple independent AI models evaluate achievements from different angles, with a meta-AI "TPC Chair" synthesizing evaluations for final consensus.

2. **Achievement Market**: A hybrid market system where accomplishments gain real platform value through:
   - Order book trading with community-driven price discovery
   - Automated market maker providing stable liquidity
   - Reserve-backed token value for achievement chains
   - Real-time price updates based on supply and demand

#### Price Discovery & Market Making

Our market system employs a hybrid approach combining order book dynamics with a market maker reserve:

1. **Order Book Mid Price**

   - Calculated as (lowest_ask + highest_bid) / 2
   - Based on actual user orders only
   - Falls back to market maker reserve price when no orders exist

2. **Market Maker Reserve Price**

   - Base price determined by AC_reserve / token_reserve ratio
   - For stable chains, maintains 1:1 parity with AwesomeCoin
   - Provides consistent liquidity and price stability

3. **Market Maker Order Placement**
   - Sell orders: max(order_book_mid, reserve_price) \* (1 + spread)
   - Buy orders: min(order_book_mid, reserve_price) \* (1 - spread)
   - Ensures balanced trading with controlled spread

This design creates a stable yet dynamic market where:

- Achievement tokens maintain baseline value through reserve backing
- Community trading drives natural price discovery
- Market maker provides consistent liquidity
- Spread mechanism prevents excessive volatility
